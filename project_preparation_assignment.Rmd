## Los Angeles Crime Data

Our project focuses on crime data collected in the city of Los Angeles, CA in the last 4 years (2020-present). The data set can be downloaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). The data set has been compiled by the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) based on crime reports in Los Angeles between the years of 2020 and 2024.

We plan to study if there is any relation between crime in LA and factors such as victim race, gender, age, location, etc. and what conclusions can be drawn from this data to better fight crime in the future.

### About the data

The data set contains 16 numerical features, and 12 categorical features. We plan to use a subset of these features for our analysis. The data has 892,934 observations over the last 4 years. Some features we are particularly interested in are AREA.NAME, Date.Rptd, Crm.Cd.Desc, Vict.Sex, Vict.Descent, and Vict.Age.

## Questions

### Question 1
How are the number of crimes distributed in relation to the victimâ€™s age, gender, and race in the last 4 years of crime data?

### Question 2
Are there certain areas in LA that have more crime than others, and how is the type of crime distributed between different areas in the last 4 years?

### Question 3
What is the distribution of the types of weapons used, and how does a victim's sex/age/race impact the type of weapon used on them?

We plan to answer these questions by re-grouping the data in useful ways and generating plots that will help paint a better picture of the underlying factors driving crime in LA.
